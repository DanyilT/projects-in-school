# Projects які я робив у своїй школі

This is where most of my projects are stored, but many of them have been lost. Here are some `Java` projects. I have also done `Python` and `Web` projects.

## About the School

I studied at the Secondary [School №3](https://school3.kyiv.ua) (old link), now it is the [Liceum №3](https://liceum3.kyiv.ua) (I hope this new link works). The school is located in Kyiv, Ukraine. This is `In-depth study of computer science` (IT-oriented) school. I studied there from 2011 to 2022 (11 years).

## Projects

### Java

You can find my `Java` projects in the [Java](JAVA) folder. There are some `Java Core`, `JavaFX`, and `Java OOP` projects. Also some of my attempts to write the code.

### Web

I completed the [`win95`](https://project-win95.danytyma.repl.co) `Web` project at the end of my studies (Feb 2022). It is stored in [another repository](https://github.com/DanyilT/WebDev/tree/main/win95) (not sure if this is the relevant link), and can look at [GitHub Pages](https://danyilt.github.io/WebDev/win95).

### Python

I forgot to push them to the repository, and now they are sitting alone somewhere on the school's computer's hard drive.
